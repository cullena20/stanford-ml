# Stanford Machine Learning
This contains all the code and lectures slides from the Coursera Stanford ML
course led by Andrew Ng. The course can be found at https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning.
I will update this as I go through the course. Note that the example folders that I
have not gone through yet are just templates.

## Progress
* Completed Week 1 and Week 2 + all coding problems (ex1) - 1/12/21
* Completed Week 3 coding problems (not sure date)
* Working on Week 4 coding problems
