# Stanford Machine Learning
This contains all the code and lectures slides from the Coursera Stanford ML
course led by Andrew Ng. The course can be found at https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning.
I will update this as I go through the course. Note that the example folders that I
have not gone through yet are just templates.

## Note on Coding Problems
I'm pausing a bit from the main course to get good with Matlab. I've been using octave in vim and really been doing stuff brute force.
It turns out I glanced over a lot of valuable stuff that only works on Matlab Online. I went throught the Matlab Onramp course to get
a bit more familiar with Matlab and it's applications. I'm going through earlier programming excercises to really grasp them and the
supplemental Live Scripts on Matlab.

## Progress
* Completed Week 1 and Week 2 + all coding problems (ex1)
* Completed Week 3 - currently reviewing coding problems an extra material
* Completed Week 4 - working on coding problems.
